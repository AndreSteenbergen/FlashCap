## What is this?

Do you need to get camera capturing ability on .NET?
Is you tired for camera capturing library solutions on .NET?

This is a camera image capture library by specializing only capturing image data.
It has simple API, easy to use, simple architecture, without native libraries
and without any other library dependencies.
[See NuGet summary page.](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlashCap)

.NET platforms supported are as follows (almost all!):

* .NET 6, 5 (`net6.0`, `net5.0`)
* .NET Core 3.1, 3.0, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 (`netcoreapp3.1` and etc)
* .NET Standard 2.1, 2.0, 1.3 (`netstandard2.1` and etc)
* .NET Framework 4.8, 4.6.1, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0 (`net48` and etc)

Platforms on which camera devices can be used:

* Windows (DirectShow devices)
* Windows (Video for Windows devices)
* Linux (V2L2 devices)

---

## How to use

Enumerate target devices and video characteristics:

```csharp
using FlashCap;

// Capture device enumeration:
var devices = new CaptureDevices();

foreach (var descriptor in devices.EnumerateDescriptors())
{
    // "Logicool Webcam C930e: DirectShow device, Characteristics=34"
    // "Default: VideoForWindows default, Characteristics=1"
    Console.WriteLine(descriptor);

    foreach (var characteristics in descriptor.Characteristics)
    {
        // "1920x1080 [MJPG, 24bits, 30fps]"
        // "640x480 [YUY2, 16bits, 60fps]"
        Console.WriteLine(characteristics);
    }
}
```

Then, capture it:

```csharp
// Open a device with a video characteristics:
var descriptor0 = devices.EnumerateDescriptors().ElementAt(0);

using var device = descriptor0.Open(
    descriptor0.Characteristics[0])

// Reserved pixel buffer:
var buffer = new PixelBuffer();

// Hook frame arrived event:
device.FrameArrived += (s, e) =>
{
    // Capture a frame into pixel buffer:
    device.Capture(e, buffer);

    // Get image data binary:
    byte[] image = buffer.ExtractImage();

    // Anything use of it:
    var ms = new MemoryStream(image);
    var bitmap = Bitmap.FromStream(ms);

    // ...
};

// Start processing:
device.Start();

// ...

// Stop processing:
device.Stop();
```

Fully sample code is here:

* [Windows Forms application](samples/FlashCap.WindowsForms/)
* [Avalonia](samples/FlashCap.Avalonia/)

TODO:

* [WPF application](samples/FlashCap.WPF/)

This is an Avalonia sample application on both Windows and Linux.
It is performed realtime usermode capturing,
decoding bitmap (from MJPEG) and render to window.
Avalonia is using renderer with Skia. It is pretty fast.

## About FrameArrived event

`FrameArrived` event is fired when the image data is ready to be captured.

* This event may be called on a worker thread, which can cause problems when trying to reflect the image in the user interface.
* Even if it is safe to execute the process on a worker thread, frame dropping will occur if the thread is occupied for a long time.

To avoid this situation, it is necessary to implement a complicated process such as the following:

```csharp
// Value indicating whether FrameArrived events are being processed.
private int isin;

// ...

// Frame has arrived:
device.FrameArrived += (s, e) =>
{
    // If the capture is not running.
    if (Interlocked.Increment(ref this.isin) == 1)
    {
        try
        {
            // Do capture.
            device.Capture(e, buffer);
            // Reflect in user interface asynchronously.
            this.BeginInvoke(() =>
            {
                try
                {
                    // Decode to bitmap.
                    var bitmap = Image.FromStream(
                        new MemoryStream(buffer.ExtractImage()));
                    BackgroundImage = bitmap;
                }
                finally
                {
                    // Finished.
                    Interlocked.Decrement(ref this.isin);
                }
            });
        }
        catch
        {
            // Abort with exception.
            Interlocked.Decrement(ref this.isin);
            throw;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Already running.
        Interlocked.Decrement(ref this.isin);
    }
}
````

As you can see, writing such a process safely is painful.
Of course, you may implement such subtlety if you wish.

However, to make it easier to implement,
FlashCap defines `LimitedExecutor` class that encapsulates this algorithm:

```csharp
// Prepare a LimitedExecutor.
private readonly LimitedExecutor limitedExecutor = new();

// ...

// Frame has arrived:
device.FrameArrived += (s, e) =>
    // Use LimitedExecutor to limit processing
    // to execute only one task:
    this.limitedExecutor.ExecuteAndOffload(
        // JustNow section: Perform capture.
        () => device.Capture(e, buffer);
        // Offloaded section (Execute asynchronously):
        () => this.Invoke(() =>
        {
            // Decode to bitmap.
            var bitmap = Image.FromStream(
                new MemoryStream(buffer.ExtractImage()));
            // Reflect in user interface.
            this.BackgroundImage = bitmap;
        }));
````

Both `JustNow` and `Offloaded` sections run only when nothing is running.
In `JustNow`, `device.Capture()` is called to capture the frame.
`Offloaded` section is executed in a different worker thread than
the `FrameArrived` event thread.

When `Offloaded` section is completed, the execution state is released.
In other words, the `FrameArrived` event is ignored during this time.

## Master for pixel buffer (Advanced topic)

Pixel buffer (`PixelBuffer` class) is controlled about
image data allocation and buffering.
You can efficiently handle one frame of image data
by using different instances of `PixelBuffer`.

For example, frames that come in one after another can be captured
(`ICaptureDevice.Capture` method) and queued in separate pixel buffers,
and the retrieval operation (`PixelBuffer.ExtractImage` method)
can be performed in a separate thread.

This method minimizes the cost of frame arrival events and avoids frame dropping.

There is one more important feature that is relevant.
When calling `ExtractImage`, it automatically transcodes from unique image format
used by the imaging device to `RGB DIB` format.

For example, many image capture devices return frame data in
"YUV" formats such as `YUY2` or `UYVY`, but these formats are not common.

The transcoder is faster with multi-threaded.
However, in order to offload as much as possible,
the transcoder is performed when the `PixelBuffer.ExtractImage` method is called.

Therefore, the following method is recommended:

1. `device.Capture(e, buffer)` is (only) handled when the `FrameArrived` event.
2. When the image data is actually needed, use `buffer.ExtractImage` to extract the image data.
This operation can be offloaded in a separate thread.

### 1. Enable queuing

This is illustrated for it strategy:

* These sample code contain using [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).
  Because it is faster and not needed to assume any thread context difficulty.

```csharp
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using SkiaSharp;

// Pixel buffer queue:
var queue = new BlockingCollection<PixelBuffer>();

// Hook frame arrived event:
device.FrameArrived += (s, e) =>
{
    // Capture a frame into a pixel buffer.
    // We have to do capturing on only FrameArrived event context.
    var buffer = new PixelBuffer();
    device.Capture(e, buffer);

    // Enqueue pixel buffer.
    queue.Add(buffer);
};

// Decoding with offloaded thread:
Task.Run(() =>
{
    foreach (var buffer in queue.GetConsumingEnumerable())
    {
        // Get image data binary:
        byte[] image = buffer.ExtractImage();

        // Decode by SkiaSharp:
        var bitmap = SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(image);

        // (Anything use of it...)
    }
});
```

### 2. Reuse pixel buffers

We can reuse `PixelBuffer` instance when it is not needed.
These code completes reusing:

```csharp
// Pixel buffer queue and reserver:
var reserver = new ConcurrentStack<PixelBuffer>();
var queue = new BlockingCollection<PixelBuffer>();

// Hook frame arrived event:
device.FrameArrived += (s, e) =>
{
    // Try dispence a pixel buffer:
    if (!reserver.TryPop(out var buffer))
    {
        // If empty, create now:
        buffer = new PixelBuffer();
    }

    // Capture a frame into a dispensed pixel buffer.
    device.Capture(e, buffer);

    // Enqueue pixel buffer.
    queue.Add(buffer);
};

// Decoding with offloaded thread:
Task.Run(() =>
{
    foreach (var buffer in queue.GetConsumingEnumerable())
    {
        // Get image data binary with copy:
        byte[] image = buffer.CopyImage();  // Need to copy.

        // Now, the pixel buffer isn't needed.
        // So we can push it into reserver.
        reserver.Push(buffer);

        // Decode by SkiaSharp:
        var bitmap = SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(image);

        // (Anything use of it...)
    }
});
```

### 3. Decode with multiple worker threads

Furthermore, it is possible to consider offloading
with multiple worker threads each scattering pixel buffers:

```csharp
// Scattering each pixel buffers.
Parallel.ForEach(
    queue.GetConsumingEnumerable(),
    buffer =>
    {
        byte[] image = buffer.CopyImage();  // Need to copy.
        reserver.Push(buffer);
        var bitmap = SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(image);

        // (Anything use of it...)
    });
```

### 4. Reduce data copy

Another topic, `PixelBuffer.ReferImage()` method will return `ArraySegment<byte>`.
We can use it dodge copying image data (when transcode is not applicable).

**Caution**: The resulting array segment is valid until the next `Capture()` is executed.

```csharp
// Perform decode:
ArraySegment<byte> image = buffer.ReferImage();
var bitmap = SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(image);

// AFTER decoded, the pixel buffer isn't needed.
reserver.Push(buffer);

// (Anything use of it...)
```

There is a table for overall image extractions:

| Method           | Speed            | Thread safe       | Image data type      |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:---------------------|
| `CopyImage()`    | Slow             | Safe              | `byte[]`             |
| `ExtractImage()` | Sometimes slower | Protection needed | `byte[]`             |
| `ReferImage()`   | Fastest          | Protection needed | `ArraySegment<byte>` |

And disable transcoding when become "YUV" format, it performs referring image data absolutely raw.
(Of course, it is your responsibility to decode the raw data...)

```csharp
// Open device with disable transcoder:
using var device = descriptor0.Open(
    descriptor0.Characteristics[0],
    false);    // transcodeIfYUV == false

// ...
```

## Limitation

* In Video for Windows, "Source device" is not selectable by programmable. VFW logical structure is:
  1. VFW device driver (always only 1 driver, defaulted WDM device on latest Windows): `ICaptureDevices.EnumerateDevices()` iterate it.
  2. Source devices (truly real camera devices) each drivers. But we could not select programmable.
     Will show up selection dialog automatically when multiple camera devices are found.
