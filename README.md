## What is this?

Do you need to get camera capturing ability on .NET?
Is you tired for camera capturing library solutions on .NET?

This is a camera image capture library by specializing only capturing image data.
It has simple API, easy to use, simple architecture and without native libraries.
It also does not depend on any non-official libraries.
[See NuGet dependencies page.](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FlashCap)

.NET platforms supported are as follows (almost all!):

* .NET 6, 5 (`net6.0`, `net5.0`)
* .NET Core 3.1, 3.0, 2.2, 2.1, 2.0 (`netcoreapp3.1` and etc)
* .NET Standard 2.1, 2.0, 1.3 (`netstandard2.1` and etc)
* .NET Framework 4.8, 4.6.1, 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, 2.0 (`net48` and etc)

Platforms on which camera devices can be used:

* Windows (DirectShow devices)
* Windows (Video for Windows devices)
* Linux (V4L2 devices)

### Tested devices

Run the sample code to verify.

Verified capture devices:

* Elgato CamLink 4K (Windows/Linux)
* Logitech WebCam C930e (Windows/Linux)
* Unnamed cheap USB capture module (Windows/Linux)

Verified computers:

* Generic PC Core i9-9960X (x64, Windows)
* Generic PC Core i9-11900K (x64, Linux)
* Microsoft Surface Go Gen1 inside camera (x64, Windows)
* Sony VAIO Z VJZ131A11N inside camera (x64, Windows)
* clockworks DevTerm A06 (arm64, Linux)
* Raspberry Pi 400 (armhf/arm64, Linux)
* Seeed reTerminal (armhf, Linux)
* Teclast X89 E7ED Tablet PC inside camera (x86, Windows)
* NVIDIA Jetson TX2 evaluation board (arm64, Linux)

Couldn't detect any devices on FlashCap:

* Surface2 (Windows RT 8.1 JB'd)

## How to use

Enumerate target devices and video characteristics:

```csharp
using FlashCap;

// Capture device enumeration:
var devices = new CaptureDevices();

foreach (var descriptor in devices.EnumerateDescriptors())
{
    // "Logicool Webcam C930e: DirectShow device, Characteristics=34"
    // "Default: VideoForWindows default, Characteristics=1"
    Console.WriteLine(descriptor);

    foreach (var characteristics in descriptor.Characteristics)
    {
        // "1920x1080 [JPEG, 30fps]"
        // "640x480 [YUYV, 60fps]"
        Console.WriteLine(characteristics);
    }
}
```

Then, capture it:

```csharp
// Open a device with a video characteristics:
var descriptor0 = devices.EnumerateDescriptors().ElementAt(0);

using var device = await descriptor0.OpenAsync(
    descriptor0.Characteristics[0],
    async buffer =>
    {
        // Captured into a pixel buffer from an argument.

        // Get image data (Maybe DIB/Jpeg/PNG):
        byte[] image = buffer.ExtractImage();

        // Anything use of it...
        var ms = new MemoryStream(image);
        var bitmap = Bitmap.FromStream(ms);

        // ...
    });

// Start processing:
device.Start();

// ...

// Stop processing:
device.Stop();
```

Fully sample code is here:

* [Windows Forms application](samples/FlashCap.WindowsForms/)
* [Avalonia](samples/FlashCap.Avalonia/)

TODO:

* [WPF application](samples/FlashCap.WPF/)

This is an Avalonia sample application on both Windows and Linux.
It is performed realtime usermode capturing,
decoding bitmap (from MJPEG) and render to window.
Avalonia is using renderer with Skia. It is pretty fast.

## About handler and strategies

TODO: rewrite to what is handler strategies.

---

## Reduce data copy

TODO: rewrite

Another topic, `PixelBuffer.ReferImage()` method will return `ArraySegment<byte>`.
We can use it avoid copying image data (when transcode is not applicable).

**Caution**: The resulting array segment is valid until the next `Capture()` is executed.

```csharp
// Perform decode:
ArraySegment<byte> image = buffer.ReferImage();
var bitmap = SkiaSharp.SKBitmap.Decode(image);

// AFTER decoded, the pixel buffer isn't needed.
reserver.Push(buffer);

// (Anything use of it...)
```

There is a table for overall image extractions:

| Method           | Speed            | Thread safe       | Image data type      |
|:-----------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:---------------------|
| `CopyImage()`    | Slow             | Safe              | `byte[]`             |
| `ExtractImage()` | Sometimes slower | Protection needed | `byte[]`             |
| `ReferImage()`   | Fastest          | Protection needed | `ArraySegment<byte>` |

And disable transcoding when become "YUV" format, it performs referring image data absolutely raw.
(Of course, it is your responsibility to decode the raw data...)

```csharp
// Open device with disable transcoder:
using var device = await descriptor0.OpenAsync(
    descriptor0.Characteristics[0],
    false,    // transcodeIfYUV == false
    async bufer =>
    {
        // ...
    });

// ...
```

## Master for frame processor (Advanced topic)

TODO: rewrite to what is frame processor.

---

## Limitation

* In Video for Windows, "Source device" is not selectable by programmable. VFW logical structure is:
  1. VFW device driver (always only 1 driver, defaulted WDM device on latest Windows): `ICaptureDevices.EnumerateDevices()` iterate it.
  2. Source devices (truly real camera devices) each drivers. But we could not select programmable.
     Will show up selection dialog automatically when multiple camera devices are found.
